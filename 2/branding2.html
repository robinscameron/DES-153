<h1>World Building Brand Project</h1> <br>

<br>
In order to come up with a brand idea for a start-up that is either a product or service for your final project. You'll meet speed-dating style with three other students and do some focus group style research. In these quick meetings you will ask the following five questions:
<br>
<br>
<ul class="no-bullets">
    
<li>1. What is something you wish you had? </li>
<li>2. What is something that you noticed in your life that needs improvement? </li>
<li>3. If it was a service what went particularly well? </li>
<li>4. If it was a product what do you like about it?</li>
<li>5. If you were in charge and could make a product or service — What would you do? </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
From this quick research you will build a brand and it's world to make your brand come to life. World building helps to make the product or service seem real. We will look at some examples in class.
<br><br>
Firstly, work through researching the realm of your chosen product or service to see what the competition would be. Keep your research images & notes in your sketchbook.
Then, create a written document for your brand : <br>
<ul class="no-bullets">
    <li>1. Brand Strategy (Answer Who? = Demographics & Why?) </li>
    <li>2. Brand Values (3 key words succinctly describe it)</li>
    <li>3. Brand Idea (World Building How? Tone, Art Direction)</li>

</ul>
<br><br>
You will have an opportunity to take some photographs with a photographer for your project in a mini-photoshoot for your brand. You can recruit classmates to model your merch for you and then add in your branding digitally creating your own mock ups. 
<br><br>

Your brand should include a (minimum) 10 page designed PDF that will walk the client through the following:
<br>

<ul class="no-bullets">
<li>—Simplified Brand Strategy, Brand Values + Brand Idea</li>    
<li>—A logo or logo system & signage if necessary</li>
<li>—Business cards</li>
<li>—Icons & illustrations</li>
<li>—A one page website, that is also designed for mobile</li>
<li>—Three merchandise ideas that are engaging (no logo slapping! ie. tote bag, mug or tshirt) For example: a plant store could have gardening gloves & seed packages, a bakery has napkins and an apron, a shaving company has razors and soap.</li>
<li>—Some art directed photos that add to substance to your brand</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
You will go through three rounds of revisions for your brand in the project, that will be looked at during a series of check ins.
