<h1>Found Letterforms Cards</h1><br>
                Your task will be to take notice and find within your surroundings to find roman letter forms (A—Z). Your forms could come from the fallen leaves from a tree, crumpled paper, food scraps, the shadows from a lamp. Challenge yourself to come up with ideas that take risks and are innovative. Take a walk to get inspired and think outside of your immediate surroundings. What’s something you see that contains both straight lines and curves? You are required to fulfill the entire letter set from A through Z. You may photograph or scan your findings, but please do not physically create materials into letter forms—this project is about observation and discovery.
            <br><br>
You will have around two weeks to work on this assignment, and it will be conducted in three parts.<br><br>
Research three directions to share in class (for Part 1), each one approached differently:</li>
<br>
<ul class="no-bullets">

<li>a. A spatial environment</li>
<li>b. Similar and related objects,</li>
<li>c. A single source seen from various angles.</li>
</ul>
<br>
For each concept, include 3 letter forms—these can be any 3 letters that you like, a suggestion to use at least one letter with curves (e.g. P, S, O, B) and at least one with straight lines (e.g. E, H, T, Y). For each concept, please create an 8.5 x 11 PDF with the 3 letters centered horizontally on the sheet. 
<br><br>

Once the format has been decided, proceed with creating the rest of the letterforms. <br><br>Lastly, you are required to present your collection as a final form in a deck of cards, these should be created on heavier stock, printed and cut to size as a 3 inch square with a 1/4 in border (so your image is 2.5 in). On the back make sure you put your name, the letterform and which way is up.<br>
